# DISTROS

* __CRUX__ (https://crux.nu): With a ports based system for installing software, BSD style init scripts favoring native configurations over configuration abstraction layers, follows true KISS principles (Keep It Simple) applied to the system and the development process. Simplicity over automation makes it easy to extend the system by yourself.  
* __Source Mage GNU/Linux__ (http://sourcemage.org): Without 3rd party patches, sensible defaults or masked packages, is free from obfuscated and pre-configured code, using clean dependencies as they came from upstream developers which provides immediate updates, and can also use flags and heal broken installs. With the package manager made in bash doesn't need obfuscated python libraries. Fully committed to GPL, uses only free software (as in freedom) in their main package, with even the documentation licensed as FDL.  
* __Harvey OS__ (https://harvey-os.org/):  Everything is a file, the hardware, environment variables, and settings are presented as "files". And with the Plan 9 file-sharing protocol the name space can mount from one computer to the other and act as a distributed service. Distributed under the GPL, is a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).  
* __FreeDOS__ (https://www.freedos.org): DOS-compatible, can play classic games and run legacy business software.

## CONFIGURATION ON CRUX
### ENABLE CONTRIB REPO
* Enable contrib for ports  
```  
cd /etc/ports
mv contrib.rsync.inactive contrib.rsync  
````
* Enable contrib for prt-get  
`nano /etc/prt-get.conf`
* Uncomment line "_prtdir /usr/ports/contrib_"

### ADD EXTERNAL REPOS
* Download httpup/rsync file and pub file from https://crux.nu/portdb/index.php?a=index  
```  
cd /etc/ports/
wget -c <URL>  
```
* Add repo location to "_/etc/prt-get.conf_" (order sets precedence)  
`nano /etc/prt-get.conf`
* Add line "_prtdir /usr/ports/\<REPO>_"

### FINALIZING REPO CONFIGURATION
* Enable pre-/post-install scripts in "_/etc/prt-get.conf_" (usually safe to run repeatedly, usually used to rebuild caches and add system users when installing certain software)  
`nano /etc/prt-get.conf`
* Uncomment line "_runscripts yes_"  

* Ignore footprint mismatches due to new files (usually not a bad thing)  
`nano /etc/pkgmk.conf`
* Set line "_PKGMK_IGNORE_NEW="yes"_"  
* Populate ports tree (is empty by default)  
`ports -u`

### INSTALLING XORG
* Install a minimal set of xorg and xorg dependent tools one by one
`prtget depinst xorg-server xorg-xf86-video-<DRIVER> xorg-font-<FONT> xkeyboard-config xorg-xinit`
* Alternatively just install the metapackage "_xorg_"
